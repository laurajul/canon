Dr. Eva Cetinić’s scientific interests focus on the challenges of interdisciplinary research at the intersection of `deep learning`, `explainable AI`, 
and `digital arts` and `humanities`. After receiving the [Ambizione research grant](https://data.snf.ch/grants/grant/216104) for the project she acts as project lead exproring deep learning techniques 
for computational image understanding and multimodal learning in visual art and culture. 
Her current research investigates the cultural, ethical, and societal implications of emerging multimodal foundation models, particularly how text-to-image models encode 
socio-cultural patterns and impact artistic and cultural production and appreciation.

Dr. Cetinić received her Ph.D. in `Computer Science` from the University of Zagreb in 2019, where she studied `computer vision` and `deep learning` for analyzing large collections of fine art images. 
From 2015 to 2021, she worked at the [Rudjer Boskovic Institute](https://www.irb.hr/eng/) in Croatia on international projects for the [DARIAH](https://www.dariah.eu/) research community. 
Before joining [Digital Society initiative](https://www.dsi.uzh.ch/de.html) in 2023, she was a postdoctoral researcher at Durham University and the [University of Zurich](https://www.uzh.ch/cmsssl/en.html).
