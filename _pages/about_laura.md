Laura is a former project member of the Research project [KITeGG](https://gestaltung.ai/#/) with a background in `interdisciplinary design`. 
Since 2024 pursues her PhD at University of Zurich UZH. Her research is embedded within the project `The Canon of Latent Spaces: How Large AI Models Encode Art and Culture` and specifically focuses on 
investigating the implications of creating and sharing highly `personalized`, open-source text-to-image/video generative AI models. 

This research effort aims to identify how broader systemic issues, such as the practice of appropriating unlicensed and/or violent material in `open-source multi-modal AI systems`, cascades into the communities that adopt, modify and share them.
